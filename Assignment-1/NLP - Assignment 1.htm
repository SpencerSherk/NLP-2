<h4>Assignment #1</h4>
January 31, 2017 <br>

<p>(1) [1 point] [document similarity:  text sections 23.1.1 and 23.1.2]
Suppose our pets have produced two documents <br>
D1 = [woof woof meow] <br>
D2 = [woof woof squeak] <br>
(a) What is the cosine similarity of D1 and D2, <i>not</i> using idf weighting? <br>
(b) What is the cosine similarity if idf weighting is used? <br>
(c) How would the answer to (b) change if we added a third document <br>
D3 = [meow squeak] <br>
to the collection?
</p>

<p>
(2) [2 points] Naive Bayes and smoothing <br>
</p>
Read sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 of the Third (on-line) edition of the text
and (based on that reading) do exercises 6.1 and 6.2 at the end of that chapter.
Show the intermediate steps in your calculation.  Compute using probabilities, 
not logs of probabilities (so instead of adding logs of probabilities,
you multiply probabilities).

<p>(3) [1 point] Using Jet (with
grammar <span style="font-family: monospace;">grammar1.txt</span>) add a verb
and a noun to the dictionary given (<span style="font-family: monospace;">tiny1.dict</span>) and parse two
sentences, using the top-down parser; submit the parses produced 
(copy and paste from the console log). <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/grishman/jet/jet.html">Download Jet</a>
and follow the <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring13/CSCI-GA.2590-001/guide1.html">Jet Guide for Assignment 1</a>.
</p>
<p>
When installing Jet, the path where you install it should have no embedded blanks.
